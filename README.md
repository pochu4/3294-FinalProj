# Final Project - MDIA 3294 - Johann Chua

This is my final project for MDIA 3294 where I create a 3-page React.js application that queries an API, displays a single result page, and allows users to save results.


I want to display the top animes but when creating the search, I used the fetch request for ALL animes, which causes problems when adding them to favs, It will either show only the top animes saved or all the animes excluding top animes that were saved, needed to be saved by the id 
EDIT: I have no idea :/
